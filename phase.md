## üß† Reflection: Challenges of IaC and Manual Deployment

This phase helped me gain a deeper understanding of how cloud infrastructure and deployment pipelines work under the hood. Here are a few key takeaways:

- **Terraform** was powerful, but error-prone without careful planning. Debugging resource names, regions, and IAM permissions was tricky at first.
- Creating a Docker image and pushing it to a container registry (like AWS ECR or Azure ACR) was new for me, but very educational.
- Configuring a container service manually (like App Runner) taught me how routing, ports, and environment variables all connect to running a live app.
- It made me appreciate **CI/CD tools** more ‚Äî because the manual process, while educational, is much slower than automated pipelines.

Overall, this process clarified the full lifecycle from code ‚Üí container ‚Üí cloud infrastructure ‚Üí running app.
