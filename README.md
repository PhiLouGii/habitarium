## Local Setup üíª
Follow these steps to get Habitarium up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js: Version 18+ (LTS recommended)
- MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance running
- Git

### 1. Clone Repository
First, clone the Habitarium repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhiLouGii/habitarium.git
cd habitarium
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.
```
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
### Edit ```.env``` with your MongoDB credentials: 
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/habitarium
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret_here
PORT=3001
```
**Important:** Replace <your_username> and <your_password> with your MongoDB Atlas credentials. Ensure JWT_SECRET is a long, random string.

### Start the backend server: 
```
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window, navigate back to the project root, then into the frontend directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.
```
cd ../frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
### Edit ```.env```
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

## Project Management üìä
This project utilises a GitHub Project Board for agile project management. The board tracks work items from Backlog, through To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done. 

## CI/CD Pipeline üîÑ
My Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, powered by GitHub Actions, ensures code quality and reliability:   
1. Runs on every push and pull request
2. Executes linting checks to maintain code style and catch potential errors.
3. Runs unit tests for both frontend and backend services.
4. Enforces code quality by requiring status checks before merging Pull Requests. 

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
Future development phases for Habitarium include: 
1. Containerization with Docker
2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup
3. Continuous Deployment pipeline
4. Achievement system implementation
5. Habit replacement suggestions
