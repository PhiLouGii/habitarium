# Habitarium: Build Good, Break Bad
*Take control of your habits, build positive routines, and track your progress towards a better you.*

## üìñ Overview
Habitarium is a comprehensive web application designed to empower individuals in transforming their daily routines. It provides a dual-focus approach, assisting users in both kicking undesirable habits and forming healthy, positive ones. With Habitarium, you can meticulously track your journey, monitor "resistance days" for bad habits, celebrate "streaks" for good habits, and unlock rewarding "accomplishments" as you progress. Our goal is to provide a clear, motivating, and insightful platform for sustainable personal growth.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Secure authentication** - Robust user registration and login system with JWT-based security.
- **Dual-habit tracking** - Comprehensive system for building good habits and breaking bad ones. 
- **Streak visualisation** - Intuitive display of good habit streaks and resistance tracking for bad habits.
- **Daily habit logging** - Simple interface to log habit status (done/resisted/slipped).
- **Dashboard analytics** - Real-time insights into your progress and habit patterns.
- **Achievement system** - Gamified milestones and rewards for consistent effort and goal attainment. 

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack
Habitarium is built with a modern, scalable architecture, leveraging the following technologies:

Backend Infrastructure
- Runtime: Node.js with Express.js framework
- Language: TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas for cloud, Mongoose ODM)
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management (Planned)
- Security: bcryptjs for advanced password hashing (Planned)

Frontend Experience
- Framework: React.js (v18)
- Build Tool: Vite
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Vanilla CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design
- HTTP Client: Fetch API (or Axios for future enhancements)

DevOps & Deployment
- Containerization: Docker for consistent development and deployment environments (Planned)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment pipelines
- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS deployment architecture (in development)

Testing
- Backend: Jest with Supertest for API integration testing.
- Frontend: Vitest with React Testing Library and JSDOM for component testing.
